# Superior Hiking Trail Tracker

The [Superior Hiking Trail](https://shta.org/) is a 300+ mile Trail in Northern Minnesota that winds through forestland alongside Lake Superior. Thousands of people hike, backpack, and run the trail every year.

While taking the Grow With Google Udacity Front End Intro Course I thought it would be fun to start a project to develop a website that allows hikers to track their progress towards completing the Superior Hiking Trail. The end goal will be a website where users can create an account, log their trips, and see how far they’ve made it. The full site would be outside the scope of this course, so my near term goal is to collaborate with other members to create a demo version of the site before the April 11th end of the course. I’ve logged Issues that classmates can work on to help meet that goal. My only request is that you commit to completing an Issue within 72 hours if you claim it. Feel free to reach out to me on Slack with any questions.
